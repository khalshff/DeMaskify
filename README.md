This project aimed to leverage super-resolution techniques to enhance image quality and generate accurate composite images of masked faces for FYP.
Implemented three models leveraging super-resolution layers for image enhancement, surpassing the baseline model's performance. 
Demonstrated the efficacy of super-resolution techniques in improving image quality, leading to more accurate composite pictures.

Project Objectives:

- Investigate the effectiveness of super-resolution techniques in enhancing image quality for masked face composites.
- Develop and evaluate multiple models incorporating super-resolution and image inpainting methods.

Scope of Work:

- Dataset construction: Curated a suitable dataset of masked face images captured from surveillance footage.
- Model assembly and training: Developed and trained models for 2x and 4x upscaling factors using FSRCNN and ESRGAN.
- Image processing: Applied image inpainting techniques to reconstruct masked facial features.
- Evaluation: Assessed the performance of each model in improving composite image accuracy compared to ground truth data.
